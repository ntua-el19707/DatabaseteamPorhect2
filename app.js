//Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web 
//application framework that provides a robust 
//set of features for web and mobile applications.
//so it is frmework that we can use and edit
//without starting from 0 so we create an object 
//to call build in function of exppress to edit
//our framework in our andavadge
//meaning can use get to retrieve data from Database
//and then construct a table in javasript and print them into route or post data to route
//send variables ex:checkboxes Critiria

//usefull https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html
//basiclly het get data drom  route and have req and res which
//are shortcut for request and respond so that is why use res to 
//respond to the user that we have succesfully using the Database

//app.use Steps to run the program:

app.use(express.json());
//express. json() is a built in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming JSON requests and puts the parsed data in req.

//The extended option allows to choose between parsing the URL-encoded data with the querystring library (when false) or the qs library (when true).
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
//path.join(__dirname, 'public') will create an absolute path,
//using the directory where app.js is located as the base.
//if  instead  you use  app.use(express.static('public')) it will work unless you try to start the app from another directory
//bassicly it it takes the path of app.js and it make it static and the we try to launch app when ever app is lauched it will use app.js path
